## Scoreboard

The example code implements a simple scoreboard to display the score of any
point-based game between two teams/players (e.g. Basketball).

The MVP consists of a simple command line UI using the keys `A` and `B` for
team selection and '+' and '-' to increase or decrease the score of the selected
team. Pressing 'X' will exit the game.
